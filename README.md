### What if I don't want the Desktop app, but I want a CLI?

Our installer walks you through these steps. We plan on removing the NodeJS dependency in our roadmap.

- **[NodeJS 20+](https://nodejs.org/)**
- `npm install -g @cerulin/chell`

## Prerequisites

It is required to have one CLI installed first:

- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)**
- **[OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)**
- **[Google Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)**
- **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)**

## Usage

**[View all commands](./COMMANDS.md)**

## Roadmap

- Remove NodeJS dependency
- Full Codex and Gemini integration
- Resume terminal/conversation fully on app or computer restart
- Replacing QR Code authentication with global email/pass authentication
- Multi-tab terminal interface
- Custom terminal launch scripts/profiles
- Settings UI and configuration
- Request a terminal from your phone
- Sync chats across all devices (iPad, iPhone, Desktop, Cloud)
