## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @cerulin/chell
```

## Prerequisites

We require NodeJS and `npm install -g @cerulin/chell` - our installer helps walk you through this. We plan on moving away from NodeJS dependency in our roadmap.

It is highly recommended (but optional) that you have the respective AI CLI tools installed first:

- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **[OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)**: Install the Codex CLI
- **[Google Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)**: Install the Gemini CLI
- **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)**: For local LLMs

## Usage
